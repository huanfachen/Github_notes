## Commands

- `git log`
  - show the projectâ€™s history
- Explaining git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project
  - `git add` specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in a staging area), `git commit` then actually takes the snapshot and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit)
  - It is always better to explicitly add things to the staging area instead of using `git add .` or `git commit -a`.
